    <h3>Biography — Backend Engineering Student at Altschool Africa.</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring software engineer passionate about problem solving.
      I have always been curious about technology and how the systems work behind the scenes, which led me to start my journey in programming.
      <br>My journey into tech started with HTML as my first step into coding. Along the way, I discovered I had an interest in what goes on behind the scene in web development.
      <br>This led me to explore various programming concepts and I picked an interest in the concept of Backend, how the server are maintained to ensure websites run smoothly and efficiently.
      <br>As I delved deeper, I became fascinated by how data is stored, retrieved, and processed efficiently, which sparked my interest in databases, APIs, and server-side logic.
      <br>I enjoy optimizing system performance, and designing efficient solutions that make applications more robust and scalable.
      <br>Beyond technical skills, I am also interested in algorithms, data structures, which are vital for building efficient applications.
    </p>
    <p>I joined the Backend Engineering program at Altschool to gain hands-on experience in building scalable systems, understanding databases and mastering backend technologies from experienced tutors.
      <br>AltSchool provides a structured learning environment that allows me to interact with mentors and industry experts, helping me gain real-world insights into software development.
      <br>Through project-based learning, I have the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, reinforcing my understanding of core backend principles.
      <br>Additionally, collaborating with fellow students on group projects helps me develop teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills—essential traits for any successful engineer.
      <br>I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, which is why I dedicate time to experimenting with different backend frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>My goal in the School of Engineering is to develop a strong foundation in backend development, learn best industry practices, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
      <br>I aim to leverage this knowledge to contribute to impactful tech projects and eventually secure opportunities in the global tech ecosystem.
      <br>Through consistent learning and practical experience, I am determined to become a skilled backend engineer, capable of solving real-world challenges with technology.
      <br>By combining technical expertise with a problem-solving mindset, I am confident that my journey at Altschool will equip me with the skills needed to excel as a backend engineer.
      <br> I am excited about the journey ahead and committed to continuous learning and growth.
